Kamran Muradov – Biography Web Page

This project is my personal biography web page. It’s designed to give a quick overview of who I am, my skills, and my experience. The page has a Matrix-style background that gives it a techy, futuristic feel.

You can find my photo, a short introduction, my education and work experience, as well as my technical and language skills. Everything is organized so that it’s easy to read and navigate.

The page is responsive, so it works well on all devices. It’s also ready to be improved with JavaScript features or connected to a backend if needed in the future.

I built it using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript, with the possibility to add backend technologies like Node.js or Django and databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL later on.

Overall, it’s a simple, clean way to show my profile online, with room to make it more interactive and dynamic over time.
